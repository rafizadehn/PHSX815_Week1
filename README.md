# Week 1 - PHSX 815 Assignment
##Randomly Generated Numbers

###**how to run this assignment's code:**

First, run the **rng.py** file found in this repository with python3. In the (linux) terminal, the command would be `$ python3 rng.py` ran in the folder with the file of the same name. This file will generate the random numbers and fill an array with the randomly generated values. It will then export the array to the **RNG_output.txt** text file.

Then, run the **plot_rng.py** file in this repository the same way. This will extract the values from the text file and plot them in a histogram.
